Hi. I am pleased to announce that the class earned a reward for receiving 20 marbles in the jar. The class voted and would like PJ Day and stuffed animals. Please allow your child to bring the stuffed animals to school. Remember, no slippers. The PJ's must be able to be worn all day.

Thank you,
Ellen
